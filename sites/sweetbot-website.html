    <h3> About the project</h3>
  </article>
  <p>The assignment was to create a Danish website for the company Sweetbot.Design. They had a styleguide that should be followed, and a logo to implement. Furthermore, sweetbot wanted an e-commerce called HotBot that should contain icons and a logo. These had to be developed and integrated on the site. The site had to be optimized for tablet and mobile devices and we had to include a jQuery element on the site</p>

    <h3> The result</h3>
  </article>
  <p>We created a danish website that contained all of the demands from Sweetbot.Design. But after several usertests, a couple of changes had to be made.
    We needed to simplify the connection between Sweetbot and HotBot, because none of the users we tested knew how to find HotBot through the banner on the frontpage.
    We also had to minimize the pictures and the text on the sweetbot-site, because the usertest showed us that it was too confusing and overwhelming, with the original design. </p>

    <h3> My learning journey</h3>
  </article>
  <p>The work on sweetbot was my first try on making a website responsive. It took a while to figure out, but we managed to optimize it for mobile device and tablet due to @media queries. jQuery was quite difficult. With only a 2 days introduction to Javascript, it was challenging. We used jQuery on a banner on the frontpage, to promote our HotBot e-commerce site. Javascript is still a language that I need to explore even more, so I can start making even more complex and inspiring websites. </p>
