    <h3> About the project</h3>
  </article>
  <p>As a schoolproject we were asked to make an online version of our portfolio, build from scratch with HTML and CSS. It had to be with a flawless coding and a structure of files, documented in GitHub. </p>

    <h3> The result</h3>
  </article>
  <p>I began the project by sketching the kind of web structure I needed to match my portfolio prototype. When I thought the skeleton was in order, I started coding the web layout with HTML in Dreamweaver and pasted the content I wanted to present. When all of the content was in place, I started styling the website with CSS. During the process I realized, that I had made it too difficult for myself to navigate in the different codes not having been thorough enough with my skeleton of the structure. I quickly learned that every detail of content has to be thought through, placing it in the correct structure from the beginning of the project in order to reach the layout I wanted. This have been a great learning process, and the next time I am to build a website, it will change my approach to the project as it will make me able to be more efficient and reach the layout result I want.</p>

    <h3> My learning journey</h3>
  </article>
  <p>I had my prototype from the first flow as a starting point. Now I had to code it in HTML5 and CSS3.
    We learned to use HTML5, in order to present content on the world wide web and style it using CSS. This was a difficult beginning, since I had never tried coding anything before. But after some training, and tutorials I became obsessed. I wanted to learn more, and I was attracted to how I knew that there would always be a coding solution on the layout in my dreams – It is only a matter of effort, in order to reach the result, I want.
    . This is still a thing that strives me. There is always more to learn – and I find it extremely intriguing. </p>
