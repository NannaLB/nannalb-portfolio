    <h3> About the project</h3>
  </article>
  <p>As a schoolproject, we were asked to make an app, and present it in Adobe XD for both mobile devices and tablets. We should also create our own icons in Adobe Illustrator, and write a report about the process of the project. </p>

    <h3> The result</h3>
  </article>
  <p>I chose to make a weather app that is supposed to be easily readable, and with the purpose of being easy to access. I wanted a weather app that could be customized the individual user, being able to show the weather forecast in a specific route, chosen by the user and sending rain- and wind alerts in a given period of time. After sending out questionnaires and targeting the audience, it became clear, that there was a market for this type of weather app. I made a sketch in hand, drawing the structure and setup I wanted, and made several user tests, and a flowchart to make the app as logical and user friendly as possible. I then began drawing the icons in Illustrator with the thought in mind, that the app should be minimalistic and distinct. When everything was set I began the work in Adobe XD, making a prototype for both mobile devices and tablets.</p>

    <h3> My learning journey</h3>
  </article>
  <p>Creating an app in Adobe XD went quite smooth at this point. I had used the program several times, and I felt that it was the perfect program in order to solve the project most efficiently and beautifully. I focused on not having any dead-ends on the various sites and making the layout and navigation as logical as possible. 
    The icons for the app had to be developed from scratch in Illustrator. We had an introduction to this program, and a couple of assignments, but I still struggled in order to get the results I wanted in the beginning. But when I had to make the icons for the app, I had already gotten more familiar with the program, and I made a couple of suggestions, before choosing the ones that represented the idea of the app.
    In this project I used Photoshop as well, to scale and adjust the images used. </p>
