  <h3> About the project</h3>
</article>	
<p>As a schoolproject, we were asked to make an app, and present it in Adobe XD for both mobile devices and tablets. We should also create our own icons in Adobe Illustrator, and write a report about the process of the project. </p>

  <h3> The result</h3>
</article>	
<p>I chose to make a weather app that is supposed to be easily readable, and with the purpose of being easy to access. I wanted a weather app that could be customized the individual user, being able to show the weather forecast in a specific route, chosen by the user and sending rain- and wind alerts in a given period of time. After sending out questionnaires and targeting the audience, it became clear, that there was a market for this type of weather app. I made a sketch in hand, drawing the structure and setup I wanted, and made several user tests, and a flowchart to make the app as logical and user friendly as possible. I then began drawing the icons in Illustrator with the thought in mind, that the app should be minimalistic and distinct. When everything was set I began the work in Adobe XD, making a prototype for both mobile devices and tablets.</p>
