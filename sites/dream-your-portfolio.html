    <h3> The result</h3>
  </article>
  <p>I started by drawing a sketch on paper, trying to make the website design as i wanted it to appear. Afterwards I made a collage in Photoshop, to set the visual direction for my portfolio project. I decided that I want a logo on the top left side, as a home- and menu-button, but I am still working on this. So, for now the button comes without logo. Then I started working on the navigation, to make sure that the site would be easy to figure out. This ended up in a functional XD prototype. </p>

    <h3> My learning journey</h3>
  </article>
  <p>Photoshop:
    We were introduced to Adobe Photoshop in the beginning of the semester, and it came in handy, when I had to do this project. I made the photos and the collage in Photoshop, and it helped my understanding of Photoshop, when I had to try it out by myself. It still has a lot of functionalities and features, that I have yet to learn about, but I am eager to learn more about this program, and I now use it on a weekly basis, to develop my skills in Photoshop.
    
    Prototyping in Adobe XD:
    My first time with Adobe XD, was in the first flow, just before developing this project, where we had to make a prototype of our dream portfolio. I quickly learned to use the program and have become very fond of it since. It helps me move quickly from an idea to what may look like a functional website. It is easy to develop a prototype, and with the navigation integrated, it almost works like the real deal. </p>
