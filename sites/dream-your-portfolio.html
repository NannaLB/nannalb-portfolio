  <h3> The result</h3>
</article>	
<p>I started by drawing a sketch on paper, trying to make the website design as i wanted it to appear. Afterwards I made a collage in Photoshop, to set the visual direction for my portfolio project. I decided that I want a logo on the top left side, as a home- and menu-button, but I am still working on this. So, for now the button comes without logo. Then I started working on the navigation, to make sure that the site would be easy to figure out. This ended up in a functional XD prototype. </p>
